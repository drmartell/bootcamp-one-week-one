        <h1>Casey's Pets: A super challenging quiz</h1>
            <article><p>Hi, my name is Casey.<br>
                I live with my wife, our two kids and <span>our three pets</span>.<br>
                Since you and I are just getting to know each other...<br>
                How about you try and guess some stuff about my pets<br>
                That might be fun :)<br></p>
                <p id='the-promise'><span>This quiz promises to:</span>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Teach you a little about my pets</li>
                        <li>Impress you (to varying degrees) about my programming skills</li>
                        <li>Be over soon</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
